# Development

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080. The service worker needs `localhost` or HTTPS.

## Tests

```bash
node tests/run.mjs
```

## Versioning

When you bump `GAME_VERSION` in `js/config.js`, set `CACHE` in `sw.js` to `'treasure-dig-' + GAME_VERSION`.
